					, I learned to use React, Typescript, and CSS to develop custom UI
					components. I also gained familiarity with SQLPro and have become very
					experienced with Git, specifically with Github and more generally with
					Bitbucket. Last summer, I worked full-time, and continued throughout
					the school year working 10 hours per week. This summer I will continue
					my work full-time again. I look forward to learning more about backend
					development and becoming more proficient in SQLPro.

					<Description>
						In fall of last year, I begin tutoring Chemistry for UVA's School of
						Engineering. It was a learning curve figuring out how to teach
						complex concepts in an understandable manner. The next semester when
						I taught four different computer science courses, I was much more
						adept and the content was more familiar to me. From tutoring in
						computer science, I have become very skilled at debugging and
						trouble-shooting code quickly.

					<Description>
						Last school year I had the pleasure of working at Walker Upper
						Elementary School in Charlottesville, VA. There I assisted in 5th
						grade classroom with students of varied learning levels. The class
						consisted of many non-native English speakers that needed additional
						assistance; I would work one-on-one with these students so that the
						teacher could focus on the rest of the class. This position taught
						me a lot of leadership and how to adapt people's learning styles to
						best help them.
